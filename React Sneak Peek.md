### What is ReactJS?

React is a JavaScript library used to craft modern day UI and views for the front-end in web applications.

> **Selling Point:** By modeling small compatible components that focus on just rendering a view, we can move business logic out of the DOM, and therefore improve our app's performance, maintainability, modularity and readability.

#### Some History

The first thing most people hear about React is "Facebook uses it."
* First used by Facebook in 2011.
* Then Instagram in 2012.
* Went open source in May 2013.

React was born out of Facebook's frustration with the traditional MVC model and how..
  * Re-rendering something meant re-rendering everything (or just a lot).
  * That had negative implications on processing power and ultimately user experience, which at times became glitchy and laggy.
